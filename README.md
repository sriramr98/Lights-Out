# LIGHTS OUT

-   Lights out is a simple game where you are given a board with some cells lit and some un-lit.
-   When you click on a cell, it reverses it's neighbours states and its own.
-   Any neighbour which was lit will be unlit and any neighbour which was unlit will be lit. It reverses it's own state too.
-   Your goal is to turn off all the cells on the board.
    Have fun.

# NOTE - DEVS ONLY

-   I know this game might be hard to win, but if you want to hack your way through this, you can use the React Dev tools to change the state of hasWon property.
